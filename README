Universal GcodeSender is a cross platform port of Otto Hermansson GcodeSender.

The primary purpose is to connect with a GRBL device and stream Gcode commands.

To run simply unzip the .zip file and double click the .jar file.
On some platforms you will need to run 'UniversalGcodeSender.sh' instead.

Key features:
* Select serial port in GUI.
* Execute commands directly.
* Execute commands from a file.
* Override speed in file (By looking for F commands and changing the number).

Improvements over the original GcodeSender:
* Duration timer while sending a file.
* Pause / Resume while sending a file.
* Table view linking the GRBL response to each command as run.
* Cross platform - use the same GUI application on OSX / Windows / Linux.
* Faster - tracks GRBL's internal buffer to send multiple commands at a time.
* More features planned.

Technical details:
* RXTX for serial communication.
* Utilizes One-Jar to bundle all dependencies into a single runnable .jar file.
* Developed with NetBeans 7.1.2 or later.
* For development you will need to install RXTX.
* To build a release open the 'Files' pane and right click build.xml, then 
  select 'Run Target' > 'onejar-dist-all-zip'. A new directory called 'release'
  will contain the .zip files.
